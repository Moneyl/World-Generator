Todo for 2019:

Now:
[] Replace rapidjson with nlohmann::json
[] Replace boost::lexical_cast and any other boost dependencies. 
[] Consider updating SFML
[] Replace TGUI with Dear ImGui
[] Replace simplex noise with libnoise. See here: http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/ and here: https://github.com/qknight/libnoise
   Also see FastNoise: https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise and FastNoiseSIMD: https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoiseSIMD

Next:
[] Try to split up massive .cpp and .h files and better organize things + refactor.
[] Fix render bugs and use better fonts, consider replacing pixel view with a bunch of small sprites. Ex: 8x8 pixels.
[] Make tile view more performant.
[] Fix occasional color bugs (cyan color at mountain / ice bases). 
[] Try replacing existing color system with hsv adjustments.
[] Add ability to save/load map settings with gui
[] Store terrain coloring variables in json

Later / distant future:
[] Let lua control terrain coloring
[] Consider wholly or partially replacing json with lua
[] Try fixing river bugs
